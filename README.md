My career in web development started in 2017,at the Sigalagala National Polytechnic,where I did a little bit of front-end design; html and CSS. Then in 2019, I attended a one month coding bootcamp at Moringa School Nairobi where I learnt some front end lnguages. Just after the bootcamp,I enrolled at the Institute of Software Technologies Nairobi Kenya, for a one year diploma course in Full stack development. In 2022, I won a two months web development scholarship at Emobilis academy Nairobi Kenya. All these stages have made me realize that a web developer is a full time learner. Every step I move to, I encounter new concepts that challenge me and make me feel like what I had learnt previously is not enough.
